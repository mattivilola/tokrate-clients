# Tokrate local metrics contract

Version 1 is derived from the observed Codex session JSONL structure available in Codex 0.159.2. That event layout is not a stable public API. Unsupported and legacy `token_count` events are ignored.

## Source interpretation

- A record is emitted only for a completed `event_msg` / `task_complete` turn with a valid `turn_token_usage.output_tokens` total and a positive whole-turn duration.
- `outputTokens` is Codex's per-turn output token count and may include reasoning output. Repeated usage records are cumulative totals; Tokrate uses the latest reported total instead of adding them.
- `durationSeconds` uses Codex's `duration_ms`, or derives elapsed time from valid start and completion timestamps when the duration is null or missing.
- `turnThroughputTPS` is `outputTokens / durationSeconds`. It includes tool time, waits, and reasoning time, so it is a completed-turn throughput metric rather than generation speed.
- `codexTTFTSeconds` carries Codex's `time_to_first_token_ms` value. It is Codex-reported TTFT and does not claim first visible text timing.
- `streamingTPS` is always `null` until a verified generation-only source is available. Tokrate never subtracts tool duration to estimate it.
- A model is `null` when absent or when more than one model is observed during a turn. Agent sessions marked by `parent_thread_id` or `agent_path`, or a structured subagent source, are omitted to avoid silently combining subagent work.
- Incomplete/aborted turns, malformed lines, non-finite values, negative values, missing output totals, and invalid durations produce no record.

## JSON representation

`tokrate inspect <path>` emits only:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "metrics": [
    {
      "id": "<64-character SHA-256 pseudonym>",
      "completedAt": "2026-10-03T10:00:10Z",
      "model": "example-model",
      "outputTokens": 200,
      "durationSeconds": 10,
      "codexTTFTSeconds": null,
      "turnThroughputTPS": 20,
      "streamingTPS": null
    }
  ]
}
```

The ID is a local SHA-256 digest of the session and turn identifiers for deduplication. Raw identifiers and source paths are never emitted or persisted. No prompts, response bodies, account fields, or other source event payload fields enter the normalized record. The native app's local file stores only this versioned metric record collection and prunes entries older than seven days. Optional metadata includes sanitized Codex client version, reasoning-output tokens, provider (`openai` or `unknown`), and source kind. Recognized CLI, VS Code/desktop, and exec sessions are primary; absent or unrecognized source metadata is unknown. Only explicit OpenAI provider metadata is classified as OpenAI.

Sharing is separately consented. Its JSON allowlist is defined in `SharedSample.swift`; it uses a random UUID instead of the local digest, rounds observation time down to a five-minute UTC bucket, and sends explicit nulls for missing numeric fields. See the README for consent, queue, Keychain, and request-lifetime behavior.
